# üîí Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Contact Tracing

Welcome to a revolutionary approach to contact tracing during pandemics! This Web3 project leverages the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts to enable decentralized, anonymous tracking of potential exposures while preserving user privacy through zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). No central authority holds your data‚Äîeverything is on-chain, verifiable, and secure.

## ‚ú® Features

üîí Privacy-first design using zero-knowledge proofs to prove encounters without revealing identities or locations  
üì° Decentralized logging of proximity encounters via Bluetooth or NFC signals hashed on-chain  
üö® Anonymous infection reporting with verifiable proofs  
üîî Exposure notifications without compromising personal data  
‚úÖ Incentive mechanisms to encourage participation (e.g., token rewards for reporting)  
‚öôÔ∏è Governance for community-driven updates to tracing parameters  
üìä Verifiable audits of system integrity without exposing user info  
üö´ Prevention of spam or false reports through proof-based validation  

## üõ† How It Works

This project addresses the real-world problem of balancing effective pandemic response with individual privacy rights. Traditional contact tracing apps often rely on centralized servers that collect sensitive location and health data, leading to surveillance concerns and low adoption rates. Our decentralized app uses blockchain to distribute data storage and ZKPs to allow users to prove facts (like "I was near an infected person") without revealing underlying details.

The system involves 8 smart contracts written in Clarity, deployed on the Stacks blockchain for secure, Bitcoin-anchored execution:

1. **UserRegistry.clar**: Handles anonymous user registration, generating unique pseudonymous IDs and storing ZKP-verifiable commitments.
2. **EncounterLogger.clar**: Logs hashed proximity encounters (e.g., from app-detected Bluetooth signals) on-chain without revealing participants' identities.
3. **InfectionReporter.clar**: Allows users to report positive infection status anonymously, submitting a ZKP that proves the report's validity (e.g., tied to a health oracle or self-attestation).
4. **ProofVerifier.clar**: Verifies zero-knowledge proofs for encounters, infections, and exposures using Clarity's cryptographic primitives.
5. **ExposureNotifier.clar**: Enables users to query for potential exposures by submitting ZKPs of their encounter history, triggering on-chain notifications if a match is found.
6. **RewardToken.clar**: Manages an ERC-20-like token (STX-based) for incentivizing honest reporting and participation, with staking mechanisms.
7. **Governance.clar**: Facilitates DAO-style voting for updating system parameters, like proof thresholds or reward rates, ensuring adaptability.
8. **AuditTrail.clar**: Maintains an immutable log of system events for transparency, verifiable via ZKPs without exposing sensitive data.

**For Users (Everyday Participants)**

- Install the mobile app and register anonymously via the UserRegistry contract (no personal info required‚Äîjust a wallet address).
- The app detects nearby devices via Bluetooth and logs hashed encounters to the EncounterLogger contract.
- Periodically check for exposures by calling the ExposureNotifier contract with a ZKP of your encounter history. If exposed, receive an anonymous on-chain alert.

**For Reporting Infections**

- If tested positive, generate a ZKP proving your status (e.g., via integration with a trusted health oracle).
- Submit to the InfectionReporter contract‚Äîno identity revealed, but the proof ensures validity.
- Earn rewards from the RewardToken contract for contributing to public health.

**For Verifiers and Auditors**

- Use the ProofVerifier contract to confirm the integrity of any proof without accessing raw data.
- Query the AuditTrail contract for system-wide stats, like total reports, all protected by ZKPs.
- Participate in governance via the Governance contract to propose and vote on improvements.

Boom! You've got a scalable, privacy-preserving tool for pandemics that empowers users and builds trust through decentralization. Deploy these Clarity contracts on Stacks, integrate with a frontend app, and you're ready to combat outbreaks without Big Brother watching.
